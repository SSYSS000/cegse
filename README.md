CEGSE allows the manipulation and the inspection of Creation Engine game save files. This project relies on technical information about save file formats provided by UESP https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page.

**This project is a work in progress.**

Currently, save files can be successfully parsed into components in memory and serialised back to disk without data loss.
